The project manages an ETL process for a Credit Card dataset and a Loan Application dataset, creates a console front-end application to view and modify the data, and analyzes and visualizes the data.


## Steps to set up and run the application

Clone the PerScholaCapstone_Tegene git repo
  git clone <repo>


Change directory to the project folder
  cd <project folder>/PerScholaCapstone_Tegene


Install the required dependencies to run the ETL and other modules using the below command
  pip install -r requirements.txt


## Run the app with the following commands in the terminal

* python FuncReq1_ETL.py
* python FuncReq4_API_ETL.py
* python FuncReq2_FrontEndApp.py


To run the codes for the visualizations, open the FuncReq3_DataAnalysisVisualisation.ipynp and FuncReq5_DataAnalysisVisualisation._Loans.ipynp in a Jupyter Notebook or similar IDE


The results of the visualizations are inside the Visuals folder
